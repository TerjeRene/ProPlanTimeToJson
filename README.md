# ProPlan Time to Json
A simple php-script that logs into your ProPlan Time account to retrieve certain values and returns them as json. Values are cached on file for a given time.

Values includes total hours this month, this year, flex hours, vacation days used, left and total.

It's based on examples from php.net and uses curl.
## Why was this made?
Partly proof of concept, partly usefulness, partly fun ;)
